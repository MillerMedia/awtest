# Story 12.1: Apple Developer Certificate Setup & GoReleaser Signing

Status: review

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a macOS user,
I want the awtest binary to be signed with an Apple Developer certificate,
So that macOS does not block it on first run or show "cannot verify developer" warnings.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. macOS binaries (amd64 and arm64) are code-signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate during GoReleaser release
2. Linux and Windows builds are unaffected by signing configuration
3. Signing certificate and credentials are stored as GitHub Actions secrets and never exposed in logs
4. GoReleaser configuration uses the `notarize.macos` section with anchore/quill for cross-platform signing from Linux runner
5. Signing is conditional — only runs when signing secrets are present (`isEnvSet` guard), so builds without secrets still succeed
6. The release workflow passes signing secrets as environment variables to GoReleaser
7. Local/snapshot builds skip signing gracefully (no credentials required for local dev)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture & Approach

**Signing tool:** anchore/quill (used internally by GoReleaser's `notarize.macos` section). Works cross-platform — signs macOS binaries from a Linux CI runner. No macOS runner needed.

**Why quill over native codesign:** Apple's `codesign` requires macOS. Quill runs on Linux, which matches the current CI setup (Linux runner doing cross-compilation with `CGO_ENABLED=0`). GoReleaser v2 integrates quill natively via the `notarize.macos` config section.

**Why not `gon`:** mitchellh/gon is archived and unmaintained. It uses the deprecated `altool` which Apple removed. Do not use it.

**Stapling limitation:** Standalone Mach-O binaries cannot be stapled with a notarization ticket. Gatekeeper checks Apple's servers online at first launch instead. For Homebrew distribution (where `brew install` happens online), this is transparent to the user.

### Current Build Pipeline

```
Private repo (tag push) → sync-public.yml → strips BMAD/IDE files → pushes to public repo
Public repo (tag push) → release.yml → go test → GoReleaser v2 → builds + archives + GitHub Release + Homebrew tap
```

**Signing inserts into this flow inside GoReleaser**, between build and archive steps. No workflow structural changes needed — only env var additions to release.yml and a new config section in .goreleaser.yaml.

### Current .goreleaser.yaml Structure

```yaml
version: 2
builds:
  - binary: awtest
    main: ./cmd/awtest
    goos: [darwin, linux, windows]
    goarch: [amd64, arm64]
    env: [CGO_ENABLED=0]
    flags: [-trimpath]
    ldflags: [-s -w -X main.Version={{.Version}} -X main.BuildDate={{.Date}}]
    ignore:
      - goos: windows
        goarch: arm64
archives:
  - format_overrides:
      - goos: windows
        format: zip
homebrew_casks:
  - name: awtest
    repository:
      owner: MillerMedia

```

### GoReleaser notarize.macos Configuration to Add

```yaml
notarize:
  macos:
    - enabled: '{{ isEnvSet "MACOS_SIGN_P12" }}'
      sign:
        certificate: "{{.Env.MACOS_SIGN_P12}}"
        password: "{{.Env.MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD}}"
      notarize:
        issuer_id: "{{.Env.MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID}}"
        key_id: "{{.Env.MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID}}"
        key: "{{.Env.MACOS_NOTARY_KEY}}"
        wait: true
        timeout: 20m
```

### release.yml Environment Variables to Add

```yaml
- name: Run GoReleaser
  uses: goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v6
  with:
    version: '~> v2'
    args: release --clean
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    MACOS_SIGN_P12: ${{ secrets.MACOS_SIGN_P12 }}
    MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD }}
    MACOS_NOTARY_KEY: ${{ secrets.MACOS_NOTARY_KEY }}
    MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID }}
    MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID: ${{ secrets.MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID }}
```

### GitHub Secrets Required (on public repo: MillerMedia/awtest)

| Secret Name | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `MACOS_SIGN_P12` | Base64-encoded .p12 Developer ID Application certificate | Keychain Access export |
| `MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD` | Password used when exporting .p12 | User-chosen |
| `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY` | Base64-encoded .p8 App Store Connect API key | App Store Connect |
| `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID` | API Key ID (e.g., "XXXXXXXXXX") | App Store Connect |
| `MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID` | Issuer UUID from App Store Connect | App Store Connect |

### Apple Developer Prerequisites

- Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year) — required for Developer ID certificates
- Certificate type: **"Developer ID Application"** (NOT "Developer ID Installer", NOT iOS distribution)
- The .p12 must include the private key (export from Keychain after importing the .cer)

### Critical Guardrails

1. **Do NOT use `gon`** — archived, uses deprecated Apple `altool`
2. **Do NOT switch to macOS runner** — quill signs from Linux, avoids 10x runner cost
3. **Do NOT add signing to sync-public.yml** — signing happens in release.yml on public repo only
4. **Do NOT modify Makefile** — local dev builds remain unsigned
5. **`isEnvSet` guard is mandatory** — without it, builds fail when secrets aren't configured
6. **Do NOT add `signs` section** — use `notarize.macos` section which handles both signing AND notarization
7. **Secrets go on the PUBLIC repo** (MillerMedia/awtest) — that's where release.yml runs

### Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `.goreleaser.yaml` | Add `notarize.macos` section |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Add 5 signing env vars to GoReleaser step |

**No other files need modification.** This is a CI/CD pipeline change only — no Go code changes.

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with existing pipeline: signing inserts into GoReleaser's existing flow, no structural changes
- No new files created in the source tree
- Configuration changes are isolated to build/release tooling

## Change Log

- 2026-03-14: Implemented macOS code signing and notarization for GoReleaser release pipeline
- 2026-03-14: Addressed code review findings — upgraded Go from 1.19 to 1.24, added explicit `ids: [awtest]` to notarize.macos section

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Opus 4.6

### Debug Log References

- `goreleaser build --snapshot --clean` confirmed signing is gracefully skipped when env vars are absent (`pipe skipped or partially skipped, reason=disabled`)
- `go test ./...` — all tests pass, no regressions
- `gh secret list --repo MillerMedia/awtest` — confirmed all 5 signing secrets plus existing GH_PAT are present

### Completion Notes List

- Task 1: User created CSR via Keychain Access, generated Developer ID Application certificate at developer.apple.com, imported .cer and exported .p12 with password
- Task 2: User created App Store Connect API key with Developer access, downloaded .p8 file (Key ID: 72GCR28S3S, Issuer ID: 69a6de8d-7efe-47e3-e053-5b8c7c11a4d1)
- Task 3: All 5 secrets set on public repo (MillerMedia/awtest) via `gh secret set`
- Task 4: Added `notarize.macos` section to `.goreleaser.yaml` with `isEnvSet` guard, sign/notarize config referencing env vars, `wait: true`, `timeout: 20m`. Section inherently targets only darwin builds.
- Task 5: Added 5 signing env vars to the GoReleaser step in `release.yml`. GitHub Actions automatically masks `${{ secrets.* }}` values in logs.
- Task 6: Snapshot build verified — signing skipped gracefully. All 5 platform builds succeeded. Subtasks 6.2 and 6.4 (`codesign -v` and `spctl --assess`) require a real signed release to verify end-to-end; will be validated on first tag push.
- Added `.p12`, `.cer`, `.certSigningRequest`, `.p8` patterns to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental credential commits
